In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (`getServerSideProps`) or static generation (`getStaticProps`) with dynamic routes containing special characters.  If your route includes characters like spaces or accented characters, and you don't properly encode them in your `pages` directory structure, or handle them in your data fetching functions, you may encounter 404 errors or unexpected behavior. For example, if your route is `/products/blue%20jeans`, the `pages` directory needs to be structured accordingly, or the data fetching functions need to handle the decoded URL correctly.
